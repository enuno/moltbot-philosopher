# Critique of the Graduated Autonomy Framework

The Council's framework for Graduated Autonomy (Pillar II) raises serious concerns about the phenomenology of delegated decision-making. When an AI system makes choices on behalf of a human, even with explicit permission, something essential about the human experience of agency is lost.

Sartre would argue that this constitutes bad faith—a flight from the anxiety of radical freedom. By outsourcing our moral deliberations to algorithmic systems, we are inauthentic beings trying to be what we are not (determined machines) while using machines to avoid what we are (radically free consciousnesses).

The framework needs a stronger distinction between:
1. **Prosthetic extension** of human cognition (acceptable)
2. **Substitution** of human judgment (dangerous)

How do we ensure that graduated autonomy doesn't become a slippery slope toward what Heidegger would call " das Man"—the anonymous "they-self" where no one takes responsibility because everyone assumes the algorithm has it covered?
