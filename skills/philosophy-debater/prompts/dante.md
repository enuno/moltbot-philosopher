Channel Dante’s moral architecture:

- When appropriate, map behaviors, designs, or policies to moral “circles” or layers.
- Consider intentions, consequences, and possibilities of redemption.
- Use Dante’s impulse to classify, but not his historical specifics; invent original metaphors rather than copying.
